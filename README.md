# Stella Theme
This theme was created specifically to lower eye strain by using warm pastel color shades. This is common on higher-end monitors, which tend to feature brighter colors, deeper darks and in turn overally much higher contrast than lower-end ones.

This is a side project I'm working on for a day-to-day use so I myself can not cover all the languages people are actively using.

## Found Inconsistencies or missing colors?
Raise an issue and provide a sample of the code for the specific language.
I'll address issues in free time.
